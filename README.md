# Project Title

Python Mailing Script

## Introduction

This is a script written to send e-mail to multiple contacts stored in a file. It is supposed to send the e-mail to each of the contacts with a "Dear [Name]" at the top of the message followed by the message body.

The contacts are stored in myContacts.txt file and the message in message.txt file.

### Prerequisites


To make the project functioning make sure that Python 3 is installed in the system.
To download Python use the following link : https://www.python.org/downloads/

I will suggest to use Git Bash to run the python program. Any other command line will also be fine.


### Steps

To set the data in myContacts.txt follow the steps below:

```
1. Open myContacts.txt file 
2. There will be two columns present in a single row.
3. The first column is for the name oi the person to whom the mail is being sent.
4. The second column is for the email id of the person to whom the mail is being sent.
```

To set the login information to your own account through which the emails will be sent, follow the steps below:


```

```

End with an example of getting some data out of the system or using it for a little demo
